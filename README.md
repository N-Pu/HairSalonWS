# Programm based on Web Services.

That program was the task that I was given by my mentor. So, let's begin: 

1. First of all that project is only for testing how WS works and nothing much to it.
2. The program itself is just a server-to-client based thing. 
3. It has 3 .java files -> Server, Client, Staff.
4. One of the main things that you have to have when you download files is this -> .pom file (You basically just have to create a project with Maven access).

And paste this code for example :

5. Great. After that just click this little button at the upper right angle:

6. Okay then, next thing is the actual program itself (for instanse: what client and staff can do with server).

# [Client]
a) Client can get the list of all services that Staff oncluded in menu. Just have to type "0" in console. 

b) He/she can get a list of free time when the Staff is free. Type "1" and after that type the day, month and year.

c) Get booked by typing "2" and server will get id of a booking. 

d) And if you wanna delete your booking then type "3"  and input the id of your booking.

e) Exit.

7. Aright, next is our Staff: 

# [Staff]

a) Staff can add new service and client can see it when he/she type "0" in clients console.

b) Deleting the service by typing "1" and typing id of the service.

c) Get the service list by typing "2" (just kike our Client).

d) Exit.

End that's that. Thanks for reading and make sure that you read all steps!
